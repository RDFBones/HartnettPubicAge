hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage1	Phase 1	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 1			A clear ridge and furrow system extends from the pubic tubercle onto the inferior ramus. Ridges and furrows are deep and well-defined and do not look worn down. There is no dorsal lipping. Bone is of excellent quality and is firm, heavy, dense, and smooth on the ventral and dorsal body. There is no rim formation. The dorsal plateau is not formed. The ridges and furrows extend to the dorsal edge.	Hartnett, K. M. (2010).

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage2	Phase 2	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 2			The rim is in the process of forming, but mainly consists of a flattening of the ridges on the dorsal aspect of the face and ossific nodules present along the ventral border. Ridges and furrows are still present. The ridges and furrows may appear worn down or flattened, especially on the dorsal aspect of the face. The furrows are becoming shallow. The upper and lower rim edges are not formed. There is no dorsal lipping. The bone quality is very good and the bone is firm, heavy, dense, and smooth on the ventral and dorsal body, with little porosity. The pubic tubercle may appear separate from the face.	Hartnett, K.

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage3	Phase 3	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 3			The lower rim is complete on the dorsal side of the face, and is complete until it ends approximately halfway up the ventral face leaving a medium to fairly large gap between the lower and upper extremities on the ventral face. This enlarged ‘‘V’’ is longer on the dorsal side than the ventral side. Some ridges and shallow furrows are still visible, but appear worn down. In some cases, the face is becoming slightly porous. The rim is forming both on the dorsal aspect of the face and the upper and lower extremities. In some cases, there is a rounded buildup of bone in the gap between the upper and lower extremities above the enlarged ‘‘V.’’ Bone quality is good; the bone is firm, heavy, dense, and has little porosity. The dorsal surface of the body is smooth, and there are small bony projections near the medial aspect of the obturator foramen. The ventral aspect of the body is not elaborate. Very slight to no dorsal lipping. Quality of bone and rim completion are important deciding factors. Variant: In some cases, a deep line or epiphysis is visible on the ventral aspect parallel to and adjacent to the face (males only).	Hartnett, K. M. (2010).

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage4	Phase 4	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 4			In most cases, the rim is complete at this stage, but may have a small ventral hiatus on the superior and ventral aspect of the rim. The face is flattened and not depressed. Remnants of ridges and furrows may be visible on the face, especially on the lower half. The quality of bone is good, but the face is beginning to appear more porous. The dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body are roughened and becoming coarse. There is slight dorsal lipping. In females with parturition pits, dorsal lipping can be more pronounced. The ventral arc may be large and elaborate in females.	Hartnett, K. M. (2010).

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage5	Phase 5	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 5			The face is becoming more porous and is depressed, but maintains an oval shape. The face is not irregularly-shaped or erratic. The rim is complete at this stage. In general, the rim is not irregular. Ridges and furrows are absent on the face. There may be some breakdown of the rim on the ventral border, which appears as irregular bone (not rounded ⁄ solid). The ventral surface of the body is roughened and irregular, with some bony excrescences. The dorsal surface of the body is coarse and irregular. Projections are present on the medial aspect of the obturator foramen. Bone quality is good to fair; it is losing density and is not smooth. The bone is moderately light in weight. In females the ventral arc is prominent.	Hartnett, K. M. (2010). Analysis of Age-at-Death Estimation Using Data from a New, Modern Autopsy Sample—Part I: Pubic Bone.

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage6	Phase 6	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 6			The face is losing its oval shape and is becoming irregular. The rim is complete, but breaking down, especially on the ventral border. The rim and face are irregular, porous, and macroporous. Bone quality is fair, and the bone is lighter and more porous, even with bony buildup on the ventral body surface. The rim is eroding. The dorsal surface of the bone is rough and coarse. There are no ridges and furrows. Dorsal lipping is present. Projections are present at the medial aspect of the obturator foramen. Bone weight is a major deciding factor between phases 6 and 7.

hpa:PubicSymphysisMorphologicalStage7	Phase 7	Hartnett pubic age morphology phase 7			The face and rim are very irregular in shape and are losing integrity. The rim is complete but is eroding and breaking down, especially on the ventral border. There are no ridges and furrows. The face is porous and macroporous. Dorsal lipping is pronounced. Bone quality is poor, and the bone is very light and brittle. Bone weight is an important deciding factor. The dorsal surface of the bone is roughened. The ventral surface of the body is roughened and elaborate. Projections are present at the medial wall of the obturator foramen. The pubic tubercle is elaborate and proliferative. Bone weight is a major deciding factor between phases 6 and 7. VARIANT: The rim is complete except for a lytic ⁄ sclerotic appearing hiatus at the superior ventral margin that extends toward the pubic tubercle and sometimes underneath the ventral rim, which should not be confused with a hiatus.
